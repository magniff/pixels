//! Asking a language model to edit a piece of text, off the frame loop.
//!
//! The model lives on a worker thread and is spoken to through two channels.
//! Nothing here blocks: a request is posted, the frame carries on drawing at

//! that takes two seconds to answer must not cost two seconds of frames.
//!
//! The backend is a trait so the interface can be built and tested against a
//! stub. Which model answers is a detail; that the editor can ask at all is
